How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs, face-to-face communication is vital this will allow you to get the information need for the program. This is where user stories come into pay, they help you keep track of what the client wants that way you can use them to program.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

You can choose different ways to approach developing a program. It depands on the complexity of the program if its not too complex you could use a waterfall approach. If its complex and has alot of uncertainty agile approach would be better. Some processes I like about agile is the planning poker which can help plan a project and help get clear understanding about it.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I feel to be a good team member there need to be respect for those you are working with and be able to bring knowledge to the table.
